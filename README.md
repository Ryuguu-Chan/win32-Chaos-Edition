# win32-Chaos-Edition
A simple VBS Script that will make your computing experience fun :)


# What it is?

It's a piece of VBS script that will make your computing experience more fun
What does it do?

It works pretty much like SM64 Chaos Edition. Meaning that it will execute a bunch of codes (commands in that case) and the whole thing will get more intense each time any code gets executed
# How to make it work?

    * Make a Windows VM
    * Once the full installation completed download the VBS file on that VM
    * Execute the VBS file
    * Click "Yes" when the warning messagebox appears
    * Done

# WARNING

You should only execute the script on a Virtual Machine in order to avoid any potential damages
If you still want to use it on a real machine. Any potential damages will be 100% your fault
You have been warned!
